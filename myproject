# Domain-Specific Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Medical and Legal Research

## 1. Introduction

Large language models have demonstrated strong capabilities in natural language understanding and generation; however, their tendency to generate plausible but incorrect information, commonly referred to as hallucinations, poses serious risks in high-stakes domains such as medicine and law. In these fields, accuracy, traceability, and source reliability are critical requirements. Professionals require systems that not only provide correct answers but also explicitly cite authoritative references.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks offer a promising solution by grounding model responses in external knowledge sources. By restricting retrieval to a vetted collection of domain-specific textbooks, guidelines, and legal statutes, RAG systems can significantly improve factual reliability and transparency. Such systems can support researchers, clinicians, and legal professionals in evidence-based decision-making.

## 2. Problem Statement

General-purpose language models are not designed to enforce strict source constraints or guarantee citation accuracy. Existing RAG implementations often rely on open or loosely curated document collections, which can still introduce outdated, contradictory, or unverified information. Additionally, many systems fail to clearly attribute generated answers to their original sources, limiting trust and auditability.

There is a need for a domain-specific RAG system that strictly answers queries based only on a curated and approved library of medical or legal textbooks and documents, while providing precise citations to prevent hallucinations and ensure accountability.

## 3. Methodology

The system will begin with the construction of a vetted document repository consisting of authoritative medical or legal textbooks, peer-reviewed guidelines, or statutory texts. These documents will be preprocessed, segmented, and indexed using vector embeddings optimized for domain-specific terminology.

A retrieval component will fetch the most relevant passages in response to a user query. The generation component will be constrained to produce answers exclusively from the retrieved content. Citation mechanisms will link each generated statement to its source passage.

System performance will be evaluated based on factual accuracy, citation correctness, retrieval relevance, and hallucination rate, with expert validation where applicable.
